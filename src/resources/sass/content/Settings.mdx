    To build a sass file, follow these two steps. The first step is to install
    the Sass module, followed by compiling the Sass files into CSS. There are
    several approaches you may use depending on your frontend framework of
    choice, because some frameworks will automatically compile your sass while
    others will not.
  </p>
  <h3>The first step is to install the Sass module.</h3>
  <p>
    You will need a package manager to install the sass module ( like npm or
    yarn) and also Node.js . You may run the following scripts to see if you
    have these packages installed:
  </p>
  <CodeSnippet
    content="node -v; 
    npm -v;"
    lang="nginx"
  />
  <p>
    If you don't already have them, you may get them here:
    <a
      href="https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/node-windows.html"
      class="link"
      target="_blank"
    >
      Install Node.js and Npm
    </a>
    <p>
      In most circumstances, you must install the Sass module in the project as
      follows:
    </p>
  </p>
  <CodeSnippet content={"npm i sass;"} lang="nginx" />
  <i>
    <b>Note: </b>The only disadvantage of using this method is that certain
    frameworks can compile your Sass files in their own way, so you must install
    it in a particular manner ( ex.
    <a
      href="https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/pre-processors.html#sass"
      class="link"
      target="_blank"
    >

    ).

  <p>
    There are two techniques for compiling the files. The first is to compile
    the sass files into CSS, and the second is to compile the sass files using
    the chosen framework.
  </p>
  <div class="mt-1">
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> The first way (compiling the sass files manually into CSS) may
      be used wherever. To build a file, enter the following code in the
      terminal:
    </p>
    <CodeSnippet
      content={
        "sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css;"
      }
      lang="scss"
    />
    <i>
      <b>Note: </b>
      If we run this command and don't already have an index.css file, the file will
      be created for us without further action from us. If you execute this command
      and we have the file, the compiled code from the scss will take the place of
      the css. Any CSS modifications that are only in the css files and not the scss
      files should be saved in a temporary file. See
      <a href={`#${internalLinks[3].link}`} class="link">
        temporary files.
      </a>
    </i>
    <h3>Explication: </h3>
    <p>
      Assuming this is how the project looks, we want to convert
      <b>index.scss</b> into <b>index.css</b>.
    </p>
    <img
      src="/resources/sass-settings/complie-folder.svg"
      style="width: 30%;margin:2.5rem auto;"
    />
    <p>
      As a result, we have the instruction below. Because "sass" is the name of
      the command, it starts with that word. The other 2 arguments specify where
      we get the sass file and where we want to compile it .
    </p>
    <img
      src="/resources/sass-settings/compile-command.svg"
      style="width: 50%;margin:2.5rem auto;"
    />
    <p>
      Hence, in order to compile, import the Sass file similarly to how you
      imported the CSS file, and the framework will take care of the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the --watch flag, you can additionally watch certain files or
      folders. The watch flag instructs Sass to monitor your source files for
      modifications and re-compile CSS after each Sass save. You would simply
      add the watch flag to your command, like in the following example, if you
      wanted to monitor (rather than manually build) your input.scss file:
    </p>
    <CodeSnippet
      content="sass --watch source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css;"
      lang="scss"
    />
  </div>
  <div class="mt-1">
    <p>
      <b>2.</b> The second approach is having the framework automatically
      compile the sass files. To ensure that it functions in your framework, you
      must check for this.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>
    What happens if you manually compile the file and the framework does the
    same?

  <h2>{internalLinks[2].name}</h2>
  <p>Sass has the ability to produce three different kinds of files. </p>
  <h3>[file-name].css</h3>
  <p>
    Is the file with all the compiled code, together with the comments, spaces,
    and order.
  </p>
  <h3>[file-name].css.map</h3>
  <p>
    By default, a file with the ".map" extension is created when you compile a
    Sass file into CSS. A CSS source map is a file that links the CSS code that
    has been produced with its original Sass source code.
  </p>
  <p>
    The name, line numbers, and column positions of the original Sass file are
    all included in a file known as a CSS source map. When employing browser
    developer tools, it is utilized by web developers and designers to
    troubleshoot their Sass and CSS code.
  </p>
  <h3>[file-name].min.css</h3>
  <p>
    With the â€”style option with the value set to compressed, Sass can produce
    CSS files that have been compressed. A minified version of the original Sass
    file, free of any extraneous whitespace and comments, will be produced as
    the final CSS file.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, you can run the following command in the terminal to convert a
    Sass file named styles.scss into a minified CSS file named styles.min.css:
  </p>
  <CodeSnippet
    content="sass [file-name].scss [file-name].min.css --style compressed
     "
    lang="scss"
  />
  <p>
    By doing this, a minified CSS file called styles.min.css will be created,
    which can be used in production settings to minimize file size and speed up
    the loading of web pages.
  </p>
  <i>
    <b>Note: </b>
    It should be noted that while minifying CSS code can aid in performance improvement,
    it can also make the code more difficult to comprehend and maintain. For development
    and debugging purposes, it is frequently advised to preserve a non-minified version
    of the CSS code.

<section id={internalLinks[3].link}>
  <h2>{internalLinks[3].name}</h2>
  <p>
    You can make a temporary CSS file if you're not the only developer working
    on the project (and you don't want the other developers to change the
    structure or they don't want to change the scss) or if you need to make a
    quick fix. If you only want to make a few simple adjustments, this is the
    perfect scenario.
  </p>
  <b>But, keep in mind... </b>
  <p>
    You are working with sass, so, occasionally you need to look at your temp
    file and try to integrate into your sass/scss files. You won't have the
    opportunities that sass will provide you with if you don't do this. You will
    lose the capacity to have all the items in the same place.
  </p>

<section id={internalLinks[4].link}>
  <h2>{internalLinks[4].name}</h2>
  <p>
    When your compiled files look like this, the Compiled Chaos will appear:
  </p>
  <img
    src="/resources/sass-settings/compileChaos.svg"
    style="width: 30%;margin:2.5rem auto;"
  />
  <p>
    In some circumstances, the [file-name].min.css file will take priority or be
    the only one needed to give our site the correct layout. Some developers
    might attempt to execute the command in this situation to change the
    sass/scss file to [file-name].min.css. This strategy will result in the
    following issues:
  </p>
  <p>
    1&#41; The original.css file will turn into a "ghost" when using outdated
    CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    2&#41; Since the [file-name].min.css is no longer minified, it will no
    longer serve its intended purpose of reducing file size and accelerating web
    page rendering.
  </p>
  <h3>The solution:</h3>
  <p>
    The [file-name].map files should be ignored; they are only there to assist
    the developer in debugging the css in devtools.
  </p>
  <p>
    The [file-name].css and [file-name].min.css files are now the cause of less
    trouble. You can use the right technique to immediately modify both files
    while keeping an eye out for changes to resolve this. Therefore, we want to
    normally build the [file-name].css file and minify the [file-name].min.css
    file. The instruction below can be used to accomplish this.
  </p>
  <CodeSnippet
    content={
      "sass --watch sass/[file-name].scss:css/[file-name].css --watch scss/[file-name].scss:css/[file-name].min.css --style compressed"
    }
    lang="scss"
  />
  <h3>Not a solution.</h3>
  <p>
    It is not a solution to remove [file-name].min.css because in some cases the
    app will get the layout from this file, even if the website is in developer
    mode and maintaining the style. Try "Force Refresh" or "Clean the Cache" to
    see the differences. It is also possible for some changes to appear when
    building the project, so it is still possible for in develop mode to look
    fine and in production to break.
