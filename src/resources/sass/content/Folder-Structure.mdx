  <p>
    Sass has two different file types: [file name].scss and [file name].sass.
    Their use of "Sass language" differs from one another. Despite the fact that
    you can use both files in the same project, the difference is in the way the
    code is written. Both file types have the same capabilities, though.

    Depending on your preferences, you may structure your code in a variety of
    ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can select between the two approaches below depending on your particular
    situation, whether you have total control over the code and structure or
    you're utilizing a framework that is component-based and permits the use of
    modules:
  </p>
</section>

<section id={internalLinks[3].link}>
  <h2>{internalLinks[3].name}</h2>
  <p>Any situation can use this technique.</p>
  <p>
    This is a traditional method in which you create a global stylesheet file
    and assign pre-made classes to the components. If you follow some patterns
    and have well-structured code, it works great. The disadvantage of this
    strategy is that it might produce a big file that slows down the website.
    However, if you don't have a decent strategy, you could start overwriting
    things and overusing the "!important" rule.
  </p>
</section>

<section id={internalLinks[4].link}>
  <h2>{internalLinks[4].name}</h2>
  <p>
    This approach can only be used with component-based frameworks. The notion
    is the same even though the method for creating the classes may change
    depending on the framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every component has its own stylesheet module in the structure. This
    strategy is best used when you wish to keep to the DRY principle (Don't
    Repeat Yourself) and include everything in your component. The purpose
    behind this technique is to utilize styles straight into components, similar
    to inline styles, but only once because you only have one component. While
    checking the class of an element (in Devtools), you will see a class with a
    name and a random number/string, suggesting that the class is dynamic.
  </p>
  <p>
    The drawbacks of this approach include the possibility of continuously
    repeating and rewriting code if the DRY principle isn't applied correctly.
    Also, because everything is dispersed, changing something could be more
    difficult, especially if appropriate abstract concepts like variables,
    extends, and mixins aren't used.
