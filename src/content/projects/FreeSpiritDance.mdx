    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The primary goal of this project is to create a vibrant and engaging
      website for dancers, a dynamic dance school, with the aim of attracting
      more students and enhancing their online presence. This website will serve
      as a digital showcase for the school, providing comprehensive information
      about their dance classes, instructors, and the unique dance experience
      they offer.

  <h2>Define objectives</h2>
  <p>
    Our main objective is to create a website that not only performs well in
    search results but also acts as the main focus of our customers' online
    presence. This website will get traffic from various platforms so that
    consumers can access in-depth details about lessons, coming events, and the
    attractive world of zouk dance. Additionally, by letting consumers quickly
    reserve their spaces in new courses via our website's user-friendly forms,
    we intend to simplify the class enrollment process.

  <h2>Gather requirements</h2>
  <p>
    The website has a **blog layout** and a separate "Events" page that serves as a showcase for the "articles" or event pages. Because keeping a **strong SEO score**was a crucial factor to take into account, I decided against using a single-page application. The rare changes and additions to articles also had a role in my choice of content management approach. In addition, given that the website is still under development, I predict that future updates will add **advanced functions**, assuring the website's continual development and improvement.

  </p>
  <p>
    I made the decision to use the <b>Astro Framework</b> after taking all of
    the above into account. The fact that Astro is a static site generator,
    which means that in final form, it would provide html files for every page,
    including the articles, with minimal js, was the key factor in this
    selection. Additionally, it has the ability of a single-page application,
    allowing you to design components to avoid repetition. The ability to
    include different frameworks into this was another feature that assisted in
    taking this into consideration.
