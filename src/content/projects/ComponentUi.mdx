    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Individuals in the domain of UI/UX have a common tendency to rigorously
      stick to set guidelines and information. However, there is a growing
      interest in understanding the fundamental concepts and reasons underlying
      these recommendations. As part of my responsibilities, I was entrusted
      with designing, developing, and administering an application to meet this
      demand. Its goal is to give consumers insights into the thinking behind
      UI/UX approaches and to empower them to design their own solutions based
      on these ideas.

  <h2>Define objectives</h2>
  <p>
    The website should be created as an SEO-friendly blog with the ability to
    incorporate custom features. It must be responsive to ensure an ideal user
    experience across all devices. The design must prioritize usability by
    offering a simple and straightforward navigation system that allows quick
    access to content.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Gather requirements</h2>
  <p>
    The website uses a blog format, and a separate "Resource" page has{" "}
    <b>custom tools</b>. A single page application wasn't the best option
    because a <b>strong SEO score</b> was a crucial factor to take into account.
    The <b>rare updates and additions</b> to articles also contributed to
    choosing the best strategy for content management.
  </p>
  <p>
    I made the decision to use the <b>Astro Framework</b> after taking all of
    the above into account. The fact that Astro is a static site generator,
    which means that in final form, it would provide html files for every page,
    including the articles, with minimal js, was the key factor in this
    selection. Additionally, it has the ability of a single-page application,
    allowing you to design components to avoid repetition. The ability to
    include different frameworks into this was another feature that assisted in
    taking this into consideration.
  </p>

  <h2>Design the concept</h2>
  <p>
    I began by conducting research on websites that provide the similar function
    and looking at blog designs.
  </p>
  <p>
    To understand the layout and how the content will interact, the first step
    was to design a wireframe.
  </p>
  <div class="photo">
    <p class="small">Wireframes Component UI</p>
    <img src="../componentui/wireframe.svg" alt="Wireframes" />
  </div>
  <p>
    The last step was to import these wireframes into Figma and begin applying
    the style (color, typeface, images, etc.). I began by initially making the
    elements I needed, such as a design system (buttons, text size, color
    palette, padding, border styles, and layout). I choose not to create a
    design prototype due to the short amount of time available, and instead
    utilize it to develop and fix bugs.

      alt="Some components from the design system"
    />
  </div>
  <div class="photo">
    <p class="small">Layout System</p>
    <img src="../componentui/layout-system.svg" alt="Layout System" />
  </div>

  <h2>Develop a minimum viable product (MVP)</h2>
  <p>
    I began developing the essential functionality from the requirements I
    gathered for the MVP. Building the most important pages—those that are often
    used—was the main goal, along with determining how the application and
    workflow would function for both content creators and end users. The
    homepage, the form (which is a disguised Google form because the application
    doesn't need to do anything with the data), the articles page (called
    guides), and the article itself (named guide) have all been implemented.
  </p>
  <p>
    The utilization of custom functionalities was another important aspect of
    the MVP, therefore I tested two different kinds of custom tools on the
    Resource Page.
  </p>

  <h2>Test and validate the concept</h2>
  <p>
    To assess the concept's potential, I conducted extensive user testing with
    individuals representing three unique user groups. These visitors used a
    variety of devices to engage with the website, including desktop computers,
    phones, and tablets. I obtained significant insights into the usability and
    operation of the website by monitoring their experiences and receiving
    comments.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am regularly evaluating the website's performance under various traffic
    situations now that it has been released and made available to the public.
    This testing step allows me to evaluate how the website responds and works
    under various levels of engagement from users. I can discover and fix any
    possible performance bottlenecks or difficulties by evaluating server
    response times, page load speeds, and overall user experience.
