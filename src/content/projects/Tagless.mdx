    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This application provides an easy-to-use HTML editing solution to meet the
      demands of developers and creative directors. It helps bloggers who wish
      to quickly modify their material using a drag-and-drop interface by
      putting a focus on simplicity and efficiency. With the use of this

  <h2>Define objectives</h2>
  <p>
    This app's main goal is to provide users with an easy drag-and-drop
    interface for editing HTML files. Once the desired modifications are made,
    the app allows users to download the edited document. It would also be
    advantageous to have a feature that shows the generated code that is
    responsible for the alterations. Three file types, HTML, MD, and MDX, each
    with unique requirements for headings and front matter, should be supported
    by the program. The front matter and header should both be editable by
    users. Users can add attributes to tags in the HTML and MDX formats,
    including custom attributes.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Develop a proof of concept (POC)</h2>
  <p>
The project is drawn out as follows: Different sorts of HTML tags will be represented as cards on the user interface. A header area to show the tag name, an attribute part where the user may change the tag's attributes, and a content section for nested tags or textual content will all be included on each tag card.
  </p>
  <p>
  There are five types of tags in this app:
  </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Media tags (e.g., &lt;img>) where the content will be stored in the "src"
      attribute.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Text tags (e.g., &lt;h1>, &lt;h2>, &lt;p>) which contain textual content.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Link tags, similar to media and text tags, but the data is stored in the
      "href" attribute. Additionally, they have a text associated with them.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Single tags (e.g., &lt;br>, &lt;hr>) that do not have any content and are
      self-closing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Container tags, which can contain other tags as their content.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Three file kinds should be supported by the program: MD, HTML and MDX. The
  app's preset tags for these file formats enable proper formatting and
  efficient production. The third file format is called MDX, and it supports
  tags that may be changed. Since MDX can be customized, the application can't
  automatically detect the type of tag, thus users must define the type of each
  tag.
</p>
<p>
  I've started the development process by quickly creating a mock-up that
  displays the required look for the cards. The goal of this mock-up is to
  depict the proposed visual arrangement. I've also described the JSON format's
  structure and how I want to use it in the logic of the program.

<p>
  After finishing the planning stage, I started the execution step to create a
  Proof of Concept. The implementation appears as follows at this time:
</p>

  <p class="small">P.O.C. implementation</p>

  <h2>Develop a minimum viable product (MVP)</h2>
  <p>
    I began putting the more nuanced components into practice as soon as I had
    confirmation that the app could be built. I developed a fresh, quick UI and
    included some additional features:
  </p>
  <p>
    You have the choice to import or export tags, as well as add or alter them.
    You can save and retrieve the content you made in JSON format. You can
    choose the appropriate file type while exporting. Note that predefined tags
    are present in both HTML and MD files. To ensure compatibility with the new
    format, all data will be destroyed anytime you change the file type.
  </p>
  <p>
    My main objective is to create the app quickly so that I can test it quickly
    and get accurate user feedback. I will be able to see how users interact
    with the app and gain an understanding of their experiences by doing this.
  </p>

    <p class="small">M.V.P. implementation</p>

  </div>
</section>

  <h2>Test and validate the concept</h2>
  <p>
    I actively used the app every day for a whole week after I published it on
    GitHub. I performed three interviews with new users during this time to
    observe how they interacted with the app. I took particular note of every
    observation made during these interviews as well as any feedback I got from
    using the app personally.

  </p>
  <p>
    It was determined that the app currently does not provide a suitable user
    experience based on the observations and feedback received during my
    personal use of the app and the interviews that were performed. There were a
    few quick flaws found that need to be fixed in terms of functionality.
    Additionally, it was determined that new features were required to raise the
    app's general usability. These results draw attention to the areas that need
    more work and development to improve the app's user experience.
  </p>

  <h2>Redesign and Code Clean</h2>
  <p>
    I have made the decision to use the Atom Design Technique for both the
    design and implementation stages in order to effectively add new features as
    they become necessary and to enable the app's continual development.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Atom Design Technique is a modular strategy that divides the design into
    more manageable, independent parts known as atoms. Then, more intricate
    parts and arrangements are created by combining these atoms. The app's
    design and coding can be more easily reused, maintained, and scaled thanks
    to this technique.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can create a library of reusable design components, or "atoms," by
    employing the Atom Design Technique. When introducing new features, these
    atoms are simply merged and rearranged to produce new components or screens.
    This strategy encourages uniformity throughout the app's design and
    streamlines the addition of new features.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may quickly iterate and expand the app by including new features while
    providing a consistent and well-organized user experience by putting the
    Atom Design Technique into practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    My strategy also adheres to the DRY (don't repeat yourself) and KISS (keep
    it simple, stupid) maxims. I minimize redundancy and improve the
    maintainability of your code by developing modular components and reusing
    them throughout my design and implementation. Maintaining simplicity reduces
    needless complication and boosts the overall effectiveness of your workflow.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process proceeds as follows: I quickly mock up a new feature or
    component, design the entire concept, then divide it into smaller sections,
    and then implement it. I occasionally had the option of using the components
    I already had, occasionally I needed to alter the components to make them
    more universal, and occasionally I had to put them into practice.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    I was also able to have all the logic and styling in one place using this
    technique.

  <p>Currently, the app seems as follows:</p>

    <p class="small">Current implementation</p>

  </div>
</section>

  <h2>Future plans</h2>
  <p>
    As I have stated, the app will continue to receive updates until none are
    necessary. Additionally, the ATOM DESIGN approach makes it simpler to
    troubleshoot or add new features to a single component. For instance,
    include the ability to right-click each button.
