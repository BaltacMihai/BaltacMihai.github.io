description: My thesis, which was published in this publication, looks at how technology affects standards and applications. Automation and technological development are shaping our civilisation at a critical moment. My approach focuses on eliminating and standardizing the most commonly utilized capabilities, whether in IT or event production, as firms implement new systems to improve operations. The objective is to provide a standard that is adaptable and can be changed as needed.

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    As technology advances, so do its applications and standards. We are at a
    crossroads in a civilization that has grown based on the automation of
    operations and the development of technology to better human lives. As
    additional programs that do the same thing arrive, both large and small
    businesses utilize them, promoting their development. The approach in this
    paper is to address the major issue, which is the most frequently utilized
    capabilities in a company, whether it is IT or event production. My work
    involves minimizing these applications and developing a standard that may
    subsequently be updated on needs and demand.
