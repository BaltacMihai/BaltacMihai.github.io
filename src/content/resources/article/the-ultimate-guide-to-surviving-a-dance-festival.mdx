  <h2>Before the Festival</h2>
  <h3>1. Take Dance Classes</h3>
  <p>
    Taking dance courses is an excellent method to prepare for a dance festival.
    Dancing as often as possible, attending social events, and dancing with a
    variety of partners can help you prepare for the variety of dance styles you
    may experience during the festival. Listening to the music during the event
    will also give you an idea of what to expect and how to move.

  <h3>2. Pack the Right Clothes</h3>
  <p>
    To make it through a dance festival, make sure you pack the appropriate
    clothing. Pack clothes that are easy to move around in and won't limit your
    range of motion. Workshop clothes should be comfortable to move in and aid
    in absorbing sweat. Pack comfortable clothes that will help you blend in
    during events. Make sure you have enough clothing, particularly t-shirts,
    and bring personal care items like shampoo, soap, and deodorant. Keep in
    mind that some of these products will need to be purchased after you get to
    the event if you are traveling by air.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also keep in mind that there can be a dress code for the events; if you're
    unsure what it entails, you can look it up online. Get ready. Although
    following to the dress code is not required, it is not the situation you
    want to be in.
