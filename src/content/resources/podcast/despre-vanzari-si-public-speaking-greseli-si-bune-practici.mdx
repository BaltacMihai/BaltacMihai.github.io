  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This is the podcast that I hosted, and my guest was Andrei Dunuta. Andrei
    Dunuta is a well-known speaker and coach who specializes in preparing
    high-level performers to produce strong and relevant presentations. He is a
    TEDx Keynote Speaker and the originator of the "SPEAKINGS" idea, which
    revolutionizes public speaking in Romania and helps to strengthen the
    country's public speaking talents. Andrei is also a sales trainer,
    supporting teams in getting more clients with the revolutionary
    #ArtaDEaNUvinde strategy. This chance emerged as a result of my
    participation in the Dare To Speak initiative as a co-project manager.
