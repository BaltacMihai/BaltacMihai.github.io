  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This podcast episode involves an invitation issued to me as a guest, with
    Necasu Nicoleta as the host. The fundamental idea of this podcast is to
    transmit the torch to others, allowing them to share their stories and
    experiences. During my visit, I discussed my experience as a frontend
    developer, reflected spotlighting the obstacles that I had along the way. I
    provided my own stories and insights on the challenges I encountered along
    the road.
